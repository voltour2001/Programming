        <h2>C++ Introduction </h2>
        <p>
            C++ is a general-purpose programming language
            that was developed as an extension
            of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm.
            It is an imperative and a compiled language. 
            C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language 
            designed for system and application programming. 
            It supports procedural, functional, and generic programming styles. 
            One of the key features of C++ is its ability to support low-level, 
            system-level programming, making it suitable for developing 
            operating systems, device drivers, and other system software. 
            At the same time, C++ also provides a rich set of libraries and features 
            for high-level application programming, making it a popular choice 
            for developing desktop applications, video games, and other 
            complex applications.
