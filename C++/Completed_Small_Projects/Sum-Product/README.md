This is a program that asks you for as many numbers as you want, then outputs the 
sum of all the even numbers and 
the product of all the odd numbers.


For example:

    Suppose we have a vector that is {2, 4, 3, 6, 1, 9}.

    Then the program should output:

    The sum of all the even numbers are : 12
    The prod of all the odd numbers are : 27
