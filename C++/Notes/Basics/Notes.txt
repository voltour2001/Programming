Basic Hello World Program:

    #include <iostream>                 Include libraries

    int main() {                        The main() function (beginning)
    std::cout << "Dear Self,\n";
    }                                   End of function

How to Compile & Execute:

    To Compile (translate to machine language):
        g++ <file-name>.cpp
    The above command will create an executable, to run that executable:
        ./a.out

    You can put the option "-o <name-of-executable>"
        g++ <file-name>.cpp -o <name-of-executable>
    The above command will create an executable, to run that executable:
        ./<name-of-executable>

Comments:

    //Single line comment
    std::cout << "hi"; // Outputs "hi"

    /*
    Multi line comments 
    */
